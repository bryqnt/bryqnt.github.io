### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I find it very useful to create an equation to find the unit price of a pizza when I am given the diameter of the pizza. I also enjoyed this lab because I enjoyed doing the math. This lab was one of the earlier labs so my partner also helped me understand when to declare a variable and when to use int or double. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because blackjack is my favorite card game of all time. My family and I would play it every year for the Vietnamese New Year. It was fun coding this game because I got to play the game when I tested it at the end. During this lab, I learned the correct ways on coding multiple statements for the cards. 

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because when I was a senior in high school, I would play a game called Wordle. Wordle is very similar to the secret functions lab, except we had to find five-letter words from multiple texts. From this lab, my partner taught me how to add multiple files into one variable to find all the five-letter words from one string.
